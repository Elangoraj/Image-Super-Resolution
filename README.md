# Image-Super-Resolution
Super resolve using advanced Computer Vision techniques which can generate high quality remote sensing images from sources such as satellites, drones, and aircraft.

## Dataset 
Images considered for training the models are paired images(Aerial and satellite). They are taken across 13 places across Asia and Europe (Suzhou, Kunshan, Weihai, Shennongjia, Wuxi, Birmingham, Coventry, Liverpool, Peak District, Merlischachen, Renens, Lausanne, Le Bourget Airport(Paris)). All images are of dimension 960x720. There are multiple image scenes such as agriculture, airport, beach, buildings, forest, land, parking, playground, road, water. These images are taken in three weather condition clear, cloud, snow during day and night.
